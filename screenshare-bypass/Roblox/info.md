# RESTART TO APPLY THE CHANGES

## Explanation

This modification **disables prefetch logging** by adjusting hidden system settings. **Prefetch logging** is a process that helps the system track program behavior, which could inadvertently lead to performance issues or detection in certain applications, such as games.

### Benefits:
- **Improved Framerate:** By disabling prefetch logging, system resources are freed up, leading to smoother performance and potentially better frame rates.
- **Reduced Risk of Detection:** Disabling this feature may help prevent software from logging suspicious activity, lowering the likelihood of being flagged for cheating or using modifications.

### Note:
The code implementing this change will be available on the MD GitHub repository. **Be sure to restart your system after applying these changes** for them to take effect.
